        <p>This tile consists of interactive trend lines for up to five scores to provide a visual correlation between trends. The following interactive features are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click a point on a trend line to display scores for that point/period in a sidebar.</li>
            <li> Right-click the trend line to display handles at the top and bottom which allow you to adjust the height of the trend line, as well as drag and drop the trend line. This allows you to stack multiple scores, or overlay them as desired (as illustrated in the following images). You may also show correlations over time (see the following section <span class="wintitle">Horizontal Variance</span> for additional information).</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Reset</span> to view the tile with no vertical or horizontal adjustments. This is temporary when viewing on <span class="wintitle">Dashboards</span>, where adjustments are implemented again when you leave the dashboard.</li>
            <li>Click the label in the header to hide or show the line. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Data</span> icon (<img src="../Images/LabelToggleIcon.png" alt="toggle labels icon"></img>) in the header for the desired trend line to hide or show markers of key points along the trend.</li>
            <li>A label displays when you hover over the trend line at a specific point with the score and date.</li>
        </ul>
