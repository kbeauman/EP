        <p>Features and functionality of the <span class="wintitle">Executive Portal</span> are governed by each user's role settings. For example, in order to move about in the system, you may see a <a href="../../toc_viewer.htm#Dashboar" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">navigation carousel</a> along the top of a page or a <a href="../../toc_creator1.htm#Side" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">navigation bar</a> along the left side. Also, some users have the ability to <a href="../../t_share_2.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">share a dashboard</a>, and some have access to the <a href="../../t_dashboard_new.htm#DashMgr" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Dashboard Manager</a>. Whenever possible, these role-based features are indicated in each <span class="wintitle">Help</span> topic.</p>
